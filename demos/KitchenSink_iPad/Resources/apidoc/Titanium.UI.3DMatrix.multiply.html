	<td class="description">The second matrix. This matrix is concatenated to the matrix instance against which the function is invoked.  The result of this function is the first matrix multiplied by the second matrix. You might perform several multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of several transformations. Note that matrix operations are not commutative - the order in which you concatenate matrices is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix t1 by matrix t2 does not necessarily equal the result of multiplying matrix t2 by matrix t1.</td>
